# NeuralNet

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.

HOW IT SPREADS

The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.

The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Some people may have only a few symptoms. Some people may have no symptoms at all, but can still spread it (asymptomatic transmission).


# Metric of success

Our aim is to build a model that can predict whether one has COVID19 based on the symptoms they show.


The accuracy and recall of our model should exceed 75%. A recall of above 75% will be needed so as not to have many false negatives.
